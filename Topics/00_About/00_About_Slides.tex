\frametitle{Welcome to UCL Engineering \& Computer Science!}

Our aim is to prepare you to be the \emc{best engineers in the world}!

\vspace{10mm}
Engineering is the discipline of \emc{shaping the world} around us 

for the \emc{benefit of humanity}.

\frametitle{Overall aims of the ENGS102P.} 

The essence of good engineering is \emc{quality}. This course aims to:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Teach you professional skills important in all engineering.
	\item Teach you computer science specific professional skills.
	\item Expose you to important social and ethical discussions.
	\item Provide opportunities to practice all those skills.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3mm}
Term 1 teaching is delivered jointly by faculty lecturers and department lecturers. Term 2 is delivered by the department and devoted to software engineering scenarios to support Term 1 concepts.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What Engineering Skills?} 

You will spend a significant part of your career \emc{communicating} with other engineers, other professionals and the public.

\vspace{3mm}
To help you we teach:
\begin{itemize}
\item Technical writing \& Technical argument.
\item Engineering visualization.
\item Technical Presentations.
\item Effective team work \& dynamics.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3mm}
Those are supported with a number of courseworks, feedback \& peer assessment across disciplines.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What Computer Science \& Software Engineering Skills?} 

Computer Science lies at the intersection of \emc{mathematics} and \emc{engineering}. It solves problems through the manipulation of \emc{information}, and \emc{computation}.

\vspace{3mm}
This module will cover:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The \emc{principles of programming} illustrated in Python.
	\item The principles of \emc{algorithms}, their implementation, cost and correctness.
	\item The tools and techniques to ensure \emc{quality software}.
	\item The organization of \emc{software production} in teams.
	\item Key tools and technologies for \emc{rapid prototyping}.
	\item Important \emc{social and ethical} dimensions of the information society.
\end{itemize}
