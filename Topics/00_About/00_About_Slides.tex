\frametitle{Overall aims of the ENGS102P.} 

The essence of good engineering is \emc{quality}. This course aims to:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Teach you professional skills important in all engineering.
	\item Teach you computer science specific professional skills.
	\item Expose you to important social and ethical discussions.
	\item Provide opportunities to practice all those skills.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3mm}
Term 1 teaching is delivered jointly by faculty lecturers and department lecturers. Term 2 is delivered by the department and devoted to software engineering scenarios to support Term 1 concepts.

\frametitle{What Computer Science \& Software Engineering Skills?} 

Computer Science lies at the intersection of \emc{mathematics} and \emc{engineering}. It solves problems through the manipulation of \emc{information}, and \emc{computation}.

\vspace{3mm}
This module will cover:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The \emc{principles of programming} illustrated in Python.
	\item The principles of \emc{algorithms}, their implementation, cost and correctness.
	\item The tools and techniques to ensure \emc{quality software}.
	\item The organization of \emc{software production} in teams.
	\item Key tools and technologies for \emc{rapid prototyping}.
	\item Important \emc{social and ethical} dimensions of the information society.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Pebble in the Pond activity} 

Friday 6 October, 11am-1pm. Jeffery Hall.

\begin{itemize}
	\item You are working in groups of 5-6 (from ENGS101P).
	\item Each group is in charge of a segment of table.
	\item You are provided materials, and need to design a machine.
	\item That takes a pebble (rock) from one end of the set of tables to the other. The pebble must only touch the machine.
	\item Aims: fun, opportunity to meet \& reflections on team work.
\end{itemize}

Arrive promptly at 11am, find your group, and pick a CS table at random quickly! Then listen to the instructions carefully.
